# List of Structural Patterns

List of Structural Patterns:

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Adapter

Intent: Convert the interface of a class into another clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Proxy

Intent: Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 

A proxy is an object that control access to another object. The main motivation from the design pattern has to do with the expensive object. Instead of working directly with an object that require a lot of resources, you can work with a proxy. An object that has exact same interface. But a proxy can delay instantiation of an object.
