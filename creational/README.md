# List of Creational Patterns

List of Creational Patterns:

- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton

## Singleton

Intent: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it."

## Prototype

Intent: Specify the kinds of objects to create using prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

## Factory

Intent: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.
